		engineer and was promoted to senior software engineer in 2022.</p> <p>The project I worked on is a mobile (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.novade.lite">Android</a>

		and <a href="https://lite.novade.net/">web</a> application that allows construction and real
		estate companies to manage their work. The front end (web and mobile) are developed using
		<a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a>. The backend runs using
		<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>
		and
		<a href="https://nodejs.org/en">node.js</a>
		using <a href="https://nestjs.com/">Nestjs</a> and <a href="https://typeorm.io/">TypeORM</a> to

I worked
		on it as a senior full stack developer designing and implementing the technical solutions. I
		spent the most time on the front end of the web application which was the most complex part of
		the project.</p> <h3>Some achievements</h3> <ul><li>Executed a comprehensive restructuring of the project&#39;s mono-repo architecture using <a href="https://melos.invertase.dev/"><code>melos</code></a>, resulting in a 50% reduction in build, 10x reduction in code generation, and improved
			scalability.</li> <li>Achieved a 40% reduction in loading time by optimizing front-end development processes using
			<a href="https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod"><code>riverpod</code></a> and
			<a href="https://pub.dev/packages/go_router"><code>go_router</code></a>.</li> <li>Designed and developed a code generation tool for text key localization, effectively
			identifying and preventing 100% of missing translation key bugs in production.</li> <li>Integrated payment and subscription features, resulting in a 50% increase in revenue within
			six months.</li> <li>Implemented a company wide Quality Assurance (QA) process and Continuous Integration (CI)
			framework, leading to a 50% decrease in bug reports and 30% faster deployment cycles.</li> <li>Established standardized protocols for code quality and consistency, resulting in a 40%
			decrease in code review time and increase in developer productivity.</li> <li>Overhauled the GraphQL API and PostgreSQL database, enhancing safety, relevance, and
			performance, resulting in a 15% decrease of the project code size.</li> <li>Code reviews and consultation on possible issues and edge cases reducing 10% of possible
			regression issues.</li> <li>Breaking down the user stories and estimations achieving near 100% project goals on time.</li> <li>Implemented the main and most used and complex feature of the application: the form template
			builder. Similar to Google forms, it allow the user to define a form&#39;s structure and then
			create and fill several instances of it.</li> <li>Optimized <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/themes">Flutter&#39;s theme</a> mechanism
			for consistent theming, and led end-to-end migration from Material Design 2 to Material Design
			3</li></ul>`,w,y;return i=new O({props:{src:"https://lite.novade.net/icons/favicon.png",title:"Novade Lite"}}),{c(){n=d("article"),n.innerHTML=x,g=m(),a=d("div"),u=d("input"),_=m(),l=d("div"),$(i.$$.fragment),k=m(),r=d("div"),r.innerHTML=L,b=m(),s=d("article"),s.innerHTML=T,w=m(),this.h()},l(e){n=c(e,"ARTICLE",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),I(n)!=="svelte-gaetxd"&&(n.innerHTML=x),g=f(e),a=c(e,"DIV",{class:!0});var t=j(a);u=c(t,"INPUT",{type:!0}),_=f(t),l=c(t,"DIV",{class:!0});var q=j(l);E(i.$$.fragment,q),q.forEach(o),k=f(t),r=c(t,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),I(r)!=="svelte-1frlkqp"&&(r.innerHTML=L),t.forEach(o),b=f(e),s=c(e,"ARTICLE",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),I(s)!=="svelte-1y8yx16"&&(s.innerHTML=T),w=f(e),D("svelte-l7g81w",document.head).forEach(o),this.h()},h(){p(n,"class","prose svelte-1sw5bq0"),p(u,"type","checkbox"),u.checked=!0,p(l,"class","collapse-title text-xl font-medium"),p(r,"class","collapse-content"),p(a,"class","collapse collapse-arrow bg-base-200 svelte-1sw5bq0"),p(s,"class","prose svelte-1sw5bq0"),document.title="Valentin Vignal - Novade"},m(e,t){h(e,n,t),h(e,g,t),h(e,a,t),v(a,u),v(a,_),v(a,l),H(i,l,null),v(a,k),v(a,r),h(e,b,t),h(e,s,t),h(e,w,t),y=!0},p:C,i(e){y||(P(i.$$.fragment,e),y=!0)},o(e){Q(i.$$.fragment,e),y=!1},d(e){e&&(o(n),o(g),o(a),o(b),o(s),o(w)),z(i)}}}class U extends M{constructor(n){super(),N(this,n,null,V,A,{})}}export{U as component};
