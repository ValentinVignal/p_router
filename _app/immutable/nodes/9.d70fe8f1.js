		engineer and was promoted to senior software engineer in 2020.</p> <p>The project I worked on is a mobile (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.novade.lite">Android</a>

		estate companies to manage their work. The front end (web and mobile) are developed using
		<a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a>. The backend runs using
		<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>
		and
		<a href="https://nodejs.org/en">node.js</a>

I worked
		on it as a senior full stack developer designing and implementing the technical solutions. I
		spent the most time on the front end of the web application which was the most complex part of
		the project.</p> <h3>Some achievements</h3> <ul><li>Re-organized the front-end code base into a mono repo using <a href="https://melos.invertase.dev/"><code>melos</code></a>. It reduced the average time of the build runner from 40+minutes to around 10 minutes. It
			increased the caching performances and reduced the build and deployment time on the pipeline
			was reduced by 50%.</li> <li>Organized and architected the mobile and web routing system using <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/go_router"><code>go_router</code></a>.</li> <li>Revamped and standardized the state management solution using <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod"><code>riverpod</code></a> which increased the overall speed and performances.</li> <li>Revamped and re-designed the entire mobile and web application to use <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/themes">Flutter&#39;s theme</a>.</li> <li>Implemented a code generation tool to manage and use text localizations in a safe way which
			prevented numerous of recurring bugs.</li> <li>Implemented the main and most used and complex feature of the application: the form template
			builder. Similar to Google forms, it allow the user to define a form&#39;s structure and then
			create and fill several instances of it.</li> <li>Set up the frontend CI pipelines to ensure code style and tests success.</li> <li>Implemented the front end part of the in-app payment feature using <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>.</li> <li>Kick started the use of <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/testing">Flutter tests</a> which helped
			to prevent numerous bugs.</li></ul>`,_,w;return r=new q({props:{src:"https://lite.novade.net/icons/favicon-96x96.png",title:"Novade Lite"}}),{c(){n=d("article"),n.innerHTML=T,v=u(),a=d("div"),m=d("input"),y=u(),l=d("div"),E(r.$$.fragment),k=u(),i=d("div"),i.innerHTML=x,b=u(),o=d("article"),o.innerHTML=L,_=u(),this.h()},l(e){n=p(e,"ARTICLE",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),I(n)!=="svelte-1k71g27"&&(n.innerHTML=T),v=f(e),a=p(e,"DIV",{class:!0});var t=j(a);m=p(t,"INPUT",{type:!0}),y=f(t),l=p(t,"DIV",{class:!0});var S=j(l);N(r.$$.fragment,S),S.forEach(s),k=f(t),i=p(t,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),I(i)!=="svelte-r4nu6s"&&(i.innerHTML=x),t.forEach(s),b=f(e),o=p(e,"ARTICLE",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),I(o)!=="svelte-4b1b1g"&&(o.innerHTML=L),_=f(e),R("svelte-l7g81w",document.head).forEach(s),this.h()},h(){c(n,"class","prose svelte-1icfrdu"),c(m,"type","checkbox"),m.checked=!0,c(l,"class","collapse-title text-xl font-medium"),c(i,"class","collapse-content"),c(a,"class","collapse collapse-arrow bg-base-200 svelte-1icfrdu"),c(o,"class","prose svelte-1icfrdu"),document.title="Valentin Vignal - Novade"},m(e,t){h(e,n,t),h(e,v,t),h(e,a,t),g(a,m),g(a,y),g(a,l),D(r,l,null),g(a,k),g(a,i),h(e,b,t),h(e,o,t),h(e,_,t),w=!0},p:V,i(e){w||(H(r.$$.fragment,e),w=!0)},o(e){P(r.$$.fragment,e),w=!1},d(e){e&&(s(n),s(v),s(a),s(b),s(o),s(_)),z(r)}}}class U extends ${constructor(n){super(),A(this,n,null,O,M,{})}}export{U as component};
