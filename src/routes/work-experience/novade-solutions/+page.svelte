		<a href="https://www.novade.net/">Novade Solutions</a>
		is a Singaporean company that provides a cloud-based platform for construction and real estate companies
		to manage their quality, safety and maintenance processes. I joined the company in 2019 as a software
		engineer and was promoted to senior software engineer in 2020.

	<p>
		The project I worked on is a mobile (<a
			href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.novade.lite">Android</a
		>
		and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/novade-lite-field-management/id1579805253">iOS</a>)
		and <a href="https://lite.novade.net/">web</a> application that allows construction and real
		estate companies to manage their work. The front end (web and mobile) are developed using
		<a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a>. The backend runs using
		<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>
		and
		<a href="https://nodejs.org/en">node.js</a>
		using <a href="https://nestjs.com/">Nestjs</a> and <a href="https://typeorm.io/">TypeORM</a> to
		connect to a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> database. The API mostly uses
		<a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> .
	</p>

	<p>
		I joined the project in 2021 around 1 year after it started and work on it for 3 years. I worked
		on it as a senior full stack developer designing and implementing the technical solutions. I
		spent the most time on the front end of the web application which was the most complex part of
		the project.
