	<p>Hello! I'm Valentin Vignal.</p>

	<p>
		I'm a full-stack developer and I'm currently working at <a href="https://www.novade.net/"
			>Novade</a
		> in Singapore.
	</p>

	<p>
		I'm a dynamic person who loves algorithms. My work and projects, I've been accustomed to
		handling diverse responsibilities and taking initiative with minimal oversight. I'm a constant
		learner and enjoy keeping up to date with new technologies.
		<br />
		I prioritize honest and straightforward communication over dealing with challenging office politics,
		focusing instead on achieving tangible results rather than engaging in excessive discussions. However,
		I do appreciate having a well-defined plan in place.
